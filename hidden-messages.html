    <p>You know what’s crazy? I really thought I was over you.</p>
    <p>I thought not crying for a few days meant I was finally moving on. But here I am… I’m crying over you again.</p>
    <p>I miss you… like, really miss you.</p>
    <p>Are you doing okay over there? Do you ever miss me too?</p>
    <p>Because you’ve been so quiet, like I never even existed. Meanwhile I’ve been here loud with all these feelings you’ll never hear.</p>
    <p>Why is it so easy for you to go silent, while I’m still stuck in this echo of us? Are you happier without me?</p>

    <p>I don’t even know where to say this anymore, so i’m just writing it here. My own little space, the only place i got left.</p>
    <p>I still miss you, a lot. Like, way more than i probably should at this point. But the thing is i don’t even know where to put all these feelings. You’ve closed every door, every way i could’ve reached out. And i get it, I really do. I’m not blaming you. But damnnnn it still hurts😭</p>
    <p>I keep wondering how you’re doing. Are you okay? Are you happy? Do you ever think about me, even for a second? Do you still remember the little things about me?</p>
    <p>I know you’re probably out there living your life, maybe even better without me, and that’s fine. But sometimes i wish i could just hear your voice, or see your name pop up on my screen. I miss being someone you talked to.</p>
    <p>I still care. I still think about you, and i hope you’re doing okay, even if i’ll never know for sure😢</p>

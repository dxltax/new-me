    <h2>Hey there! Welcome to my little corner of the internet 👋</h2>
    <p>Thanks for stopping by, and thanks even more for trying to get to know me.</p>

    <p>I’m an introvert with a spark of extroversion. I love exploring new things, learning fun and random bits of knowledge, and going on little adventures (even if it's just through books or thoughts). Crowds and loud places aren’t really my thing, they drain me. But if you’re on the same wavelength, that’s a whole different story ehehehe.</p>

    <p>I get bored pretty easily, so small talk? Not my vibe. It’s not that I’m being rude, it’s just that i crave depth and connection. I’m also into writing and reading, though most of my “novels” are just half-finished drafts tucked away like little secrets… oops. I read all sorts of books, but don’t worry, i promise i’m not one of those boring bookworms people joke about.</p>

    <p>I’m always open to meeting new people, but i’m also selective. I can be kind and friendly to everyone, but not everyone ends up being part of my circle. Is that being arrogant? I don’t think so. It's just my way of protecting my peace and keeping my mental space safe from energy that might not be good for me.</p>

    <p>Of course, like any human, i have my pet peeves. I hate being ignored, and i have no patience for people who lack self-awareness or basic respect. On the flip side, i absolutely adore when someone remembers the little things about me. That’s how i show love, too… through details. Isn’t it beautiful when people genuinely pay attention to each other?</p>

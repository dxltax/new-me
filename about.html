  <h2>Hey there! Welcome to my little corner of the internet 👋</h2>
  <p>I’m so glad you stopped by! Let me give you a glimpse into who i am.</p>

  <p>I'm an introvert with a spark of extroversion, and while i might shy away from loud crowds, i absolutely love exploring new things, especially when it comes to technology. A huge chunk of my life revolves around learning and diving deep into tech (it’s my thing ehehehe). I thrive on discovering cool gadgets, new programming languages, and anything that pushes the boundaries of innovation. But when i'm not tinkering with the latest tech, you’ll probably find me indulging in some quiet reading or daydreaming through my books😁</p>

  <p>I get bored pretty easily, so small talk is definitely not my vibe. It’s not that i’m being rude, it’s just that i crave depth and connection. Don’t get me wrongggg, i can be sweet and friendly to anyone, though only a few make it into my circle. Is that being arrogant? I don’t think so. It's just my way of protecting my peace and keeping my mental space safe from energy that might not be good for me.</p>

  <p>One thing i adore? Hmmm surprises and romance, i guess. There’s something so enchanting about the unexpected. I love doing little romantic gestures, whether it’s planning a surprise or simply showing appreciation in small ways. I believe that love is in the details, and i cherish when others notice those small things about me too.</p>

  <p>And of course, like any human, i have my pet peeves. I hate being ignored, and i have no patience for people who lack self-awareness or basic respect. But on the flip side, i’m all about celebrating the little things that make life extraordinary. Life’s too short to not enjoy the surprises it brings ehehe and i try to make sure there’s plenty of magic in mine.</p>

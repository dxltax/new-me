  <p> I see how strong you are. How you’ve taught yourself to be okay, to handle things on your own, to keep moving even when the weight gets unbearable. And maybe you don’t say much. Maybe you laugh when it hurts and shrug when you’re breaking inside.</p>
  <p> But I’m not here to question your strength. I admire it. I just want to remind you, <strong>you don’t have to be strong all the time.</strong> Not with me.</p>
  <p> You have me now. Someone who doesn’t want to fix you, just to stand beside you when your world gets too heavy. You don’t have to hide your sadness. Or swallow your anger. Or hold back your exhaustion. </p>
  <p> Let me be the one you lean on when your knees get tired. Let me carry some of what’s weighing you down, so your shoulders don’t feel like they’re crumbling. </p>
  <p> I know you can do this alone. You always have. But I hope you’ll let me walk with you anyway. Because real love isn’t just about admiration. It’s about presence. It’s about whispering “I’m here” even when you’re too tired to ask.</p>`

  <p>I no longer reach for your name when something beautiful happens. I no longer wait for your replies or wonder what you’re doing at 2am. But that doesn’t mean I stopped loving you. It just means I’ve learned to do it differently.</p>
  <p>I pray for you in silence now. Not with desperation, but with gentleness. With the kind of love that doesn’t beg to be seen, only hopes you’re okay.</p>
  <p>I wish you peace, even if I’m not the one holding your hand. I wish you joy, even if my name no longer makes you smile. And when I miss you (because I still do), I close my eyes, take a breath, and let the ache become a quiet blessing, instead of a scream.</p>
  <p>Thi s love no longer asks to be returned. It just wants to see you happy, even from a distance.</p>
  <p>Because sometimes, the purest kind of love is the one that never asks for anything back.</p>`

  <p>We may not end up together. Not as two people who call each other home, not as two hearts that get to stay side by side. But if that’s how our story unfolds,
then at least come back as someone who once believed in us. As someone who once hoped like I did.</p>
  <p>Let’s return, not as lovers, but as two souls who once made a promise <strong>to never hurt each other, never leave each other, even when the love changed its shape.</strong></p>
  <p>Let’s go back to kindness, to softness, to that quiet understanding we once had before the world got in the way.</p>
  <p>It won’t be easy. There will be days where we still ache for what we couldn’t keep. But maybe… maybe being friends who care too much is still better than becoming strangers who pretend we never did.</p>
  <p>So if we must let go, let’s do it gently. Let’s be the kind of ending that still holds warmth, not silence. Because no matter how it ends, I’d rather have you close… even if it’s not the way I once dreamed.</p>`

  text: `<p><strong>I Lied When I Said I Was Okay</strong></p>
  <p>I lied. When they asked if I was fine, when I smiled and said, “I’m doing better now.” I lied. Because the truth is, I’m still struggling to breathe without her. I’m still carrying the weight of everything we’ll never get to be.</p>
  <p>I tell myself every day to move forward, to heal, to let her memory soften instead of suffocate. And I try, I really do.</p>
  <p>But some days, like today, the air feels too heavy.
The knowing crushes me, <strong>there will be no more stolen glances, no more soft moments, no more chance to stay a little longer in her world.</strong></p>
  <p>It’s not just missing her. It’s missing the version of myself that only existed with her.</p>
  <p>I’m not okay. I’m surviving. I’m pretending. I’m waiting for the ache to dull into something I can carry without breaking every time I remember she’s gone. And maybe one day, I’ll stop lying… not to the world, but to myself.</p>
<p>Until then, I’ll just keep breathing through the hurt, even if every breath feels like another goodbye.</p>`

  text: `<p><strong>I’m not just surviving without her, I’m building something better because she’s gone.</strong></p>
  <p>In the beginning, it was just about making it through the day. Waking up, breathing, existing.</p>
  <p>Every little thing reminded me of her. Perfume, vinyl, places we planned to go. It felt like living in a world full of ghosts.</p>
  <p>But slowly I started changing things. My routines, my space, my dreams. Not to erase her, but to reclaim me. To build a life that didn’t revolve around missing someone.</p>
  <p>Now, I wake up to new goals. New reasons to smile. New ways to be proud of myself that have nothing to do with her. </p>
  <p>Losing her felt like losing my whole world. But it turns out, she wasn’t the whole world. She was just a chapter.</p>
  <p>And now, I’m writing new ones. Ones where I’m the main character. Ones where love doesn’t mean losing myself. I’m not just surviving anymore. I’m rebuilding. And this time, it’s all mine.</p>`

  text: `<p><strong>Just because she couldn’t choose me, doesn’t mean I wasn’t worth choosing.</strong></p>
  <p>There was a time I thought her leaving meant I wasn’t enough. That maybe if I’d been more, done more, loved differently, she would’ve stayed. I kept replaying everything, trying to find what I could’ve fixed. As if love was something I failed at. </p>
  <p>But here’s what I know now, <strong>SOMEONE NOT CHOOSING YOU DOESN’T MEAN YOU’RE UNWORTHY!</strong></p>
  <p>She made a choice. One I didn’t understand, but one I’ve learned to respect, not because it didn’t hurt, but because I finally chose myself too.</p>
  <p>My worth was never tied to her decision. It’s not a reflection of how lovable I am, how good I was, or how deeply I cared.</p>
  <p>I was enough when she met me. I was enough when she loved me. And I was still enough when she left.</p>
  <p>So no, her not choosing me doesn’t mean I wasn’t worth choosing. It just means I’m still waiting for someone who sees me as I am and stays. </p>`

  text: `<p><strong>I don’t hate her. I don’t even blame her. I just finally accepted that love alone wasn’t enough.</strong></p>
  <p>We loved each other. That part was real. No matter how it ended, I’ll never question that. But love, as powerful and beautiful as it is, can’t survive on its own.</p>
  <p>It needs space. It needs choice. It needs people who are ready for the same kind of fight. And maybe she wasn’t ready, or maybe she was tired. Either way, she made her choice.</p>
  <p>For a while, I kept asking why. Why she let go when I still held on. Why she stopped when I still believed.</p>
  <p>But now, I’ve stopped looking for answers that won’t come. Because the truth is, there’s no villain in this story. Just two people who couldn’t make it work.</p>
  <p>I don’t hate her. I still wish her well. Because what we had, even if it didn’t last meant something.</p>
  <p>I’m no longer bitter. Just honest. Love brought us together. But it wasn’t enough to keep us there.</p>
  <p>And that’s okay.</p>`

  text: `<p><strong>This isn’t the end of my story, it’s just a new chapter.</strong></p>
  <p>Sometimes, life hits hard. The kind of hit that leaves you breathless and unsure of what comes next. I never imagined I’d be here, trying to make sense of something that feels impossible to understand, but here I am.</p>
  <p>The truth is, I thought this love would last forever. I thought we’d figure it out. But some things aren’t meant to be forever.</p>
  <p>I spent so much time clinging to what we had, that I almost forgot what I had left, <strong>MYSELF</strong>.</p>
  <p>So now, instead of holding on to what was, I’m learning to embrace what is. The pain, the lessons, and the freedom that comes with letting go.</p>
  <p>I’m not going to pretend it doesn’t hurt, because it does. But I’m starting to see it differently. This isn’t the end of my story. It’s just a new chapter. A chapter where I learn to stand taller, love deeper, and live freer.</p>
  <p>And maybe, someday, I’ll look back and thank the heartbreak. For teaching me that even in the hardest endings, there’s always the possibility of a beautiful new beginning.</p>`

  <p>When she left, I thought I was losing everything I’d built. But the truth is, I was only losing the part of me that was stuck in the past.</p>
  <p>I didn’t want to walk away. I didn’t want to let go. But sometimes, the best choice isn’t the one you want, it’s the one you need.</p>
  <p>I spent so much time wishing things were different, that I forgot to see what was in front of me, a chance to heal, to grow, to move forward.</p>
  <p>Healing wasn’t a straight line. It was messy. It was confusing. And at times, it felt impossible. But little by little, I started to rebuild. Not with her, but with me.</p>
  <p>I started to understand that healing doesn’t mean forgetting. It means accepting what was and choosing to be okay without it.</p>
  <p>I didn’t choose to walk away, but I chose to heal. And in that choice, I found myself again.</p>
  <p>Now, I’m not waiting for closure. I’m creating it. Because sometimes, the only closure you need is the one you give yourself.</p>`

  text: `<p><strong>Some love stories don’t end because of lack of love, they end because the world made it too hard to hold on.</strong></p>
  <p>Ours didn’t end with a fight. No one cheated. No one lied. We simply ran out of room to exist.</p>
  <p>We loved each other. Fully. Quietly. Bravely. But even the strongest love needs space to breathe.</p>
  <p>The world around us didn’t give us that space. It made our love feel like a secret that had to be protected, until protecting it became too heavy.</p>
  <p>She chose to let go. I didn’t blame her. But I’d be lying if I said it didn’t break something in me. Because I was willing to stay. Willing to weather it all. But she chose the quiet, and left me holding the noise of what we could’ve been.</p>
  <p>That’s the hardest part, knowing love didn’t end, but one of us did. I’m still learning how to heal from something that wasn’t wrong, just impossible.</p>
  <p>Maybe one day, the world will be softer. And love like ours won’t have to choose between survival and truth.</p>`

  text: `<p><strong>No one saw how much it hurt, but I kept healing anyway.</strong></p>
  <p>Breakups are weird. The world kept spinning while mine felt like it just fell apart. People told me “you’ll be okay” like it was a switch I could flip. But they didn’t see the nights I couldn’t sleep. The mornings I didn’t even want to get out of bed.</p>
  <p>No one truly knew what it took to hold myself together while the one person who felt like home stopped choosing me. I cried in private. I smiled in public. I pretended I was fine, until I almost believed it.</p>
  <p>But here’s the thing… I didn’t wait for anyone to save me. I picked myself up. I held my own hand. I whispered “I’ll be okay” even when it felt like a lie.</p>
  <p>That’s real healing. Not loud. Not pretty. Not always seen, but powerful as hell.</p>
  <p>They didn’t see how much it hurt. But look at me now, still standing. Still moving. Still becoming someone stronger than I ever expected.</p>`

  text: `<p><strong>She was a chapter, not the whole story.</strong></p>
  <p>For a long time, I treated her like the ending. Like once she left, nothing else would ever make sense. I thought she was the one. The final piece. The person I’d grow old with.</p>
  <p>But now I see her for what she truly was. A chapter. A meaningful one, yes. But still, just a chapter.</p>
  <p>She taught me how deeply I could feel. How much I could give. And what I should never settle for again. She helped me find parts of myself I didn’t know existed. And when she left, she took some of them with her, but not all of them.</p>
  <p>What she didn’t take was my will to keep going. My ability to rebuild. My hope for something real.</p>
  <p>My story didn’t end with her. It started a new arc, one that’s mine alone to write.</p>
  <p>She wasn’t the whole book. She was just a chapter. And I’ve still got pages to turn.</p>`

  <p>I used to check my phone more than I’d like to admit. Waiting for her name to pop up. Waiting for “I miss you.”</p>
  <p>Every song felt like a message. Every quiet night felt like a chance for her to finally remember me.</p>
  <p>But hours turned into days. Days into weeks. And silence stayed loyal to her decision.</p>
  <p>One day, I just stopped waiting. No big moment. No dramatic shift. Just peace. Quiet. Acceptance.</p>
  <p>I don’t replay our memories like I used to. I don’t hold space for her in my future plans. Not because I stopped caring, but because I finally started caring more about me.</p>
  <p>Healing doesn’t always look loud. Sometimes it looks like forgetting to hope she’ll text you back. Sometimes it looks like not noticing you’ve already moved on.</p>
  <p>I don’t wait for her anymore. Not because I hate her, but because I’m finally walking forward with both hands free.</p>`

        <p>At first, it was just about surviving. One day at a time. Breathing through the ache she left behind.</p>
        <p>I didn’t have a roadmap. Didn’t know when it would stop hurting. I just kept going, even when it felt pointless. But somewhere along the way, something shifted. The pain didn’t disappear, I just got stronger.</p>
        <p>I started showing up for myself. Fixing what I ignored. Focusing on what I used to put last, <strong>ME</strong>.</p>
        <p>I found joy in small wins. In peaceful mornings. In people who stayed. And suddenly, it wasn’t about her anymore. It was about the person I was becoming without her.</p>
        <p>I didn’t just let go of the past. I built a new future, one where I don’t settle for less than I deserve. So no, I didn’t just move on. I grew up. I glowed up. And I’m just getting started.</p>`

        <p>After her, I told myself I was done. No more getting attached. No more “what ifs.” Just me, myself, and healing.</p>
        <p>And for a while, that was exactly what I needed. Silence. Solitude. Space to rebuild.</p>
        <p>But lately, there’s been a shift. Not in a dramatic way, just in small, quiet thoughts like, “maybe one day…”</p>
        <p>Maybe one day, someone new will laugh at my dumb jokes. Hold my hand without letting go. Choose me and mean it.</p>
        <p>I’m not desperate for it. I’m not out there searching. But I’m also not pretending I don’t want to love again. Because I do. But this time, it’ll be different. This time, I’ll bring a version of me that knows her worth.</p>
        <p>She broke my heart, yes. But she didn’t break my ability to love. She just taught me how to love better, starting with myself.</p>

  <p>Maybe this life wasn’t built for us. Maybe the stars didn’t align the way we needed them to. Maybe fate had other plans, and we are just two souls almost touching, almost belonging, but never quite crossing the distance.</p>
  <p>Today, I know I can’t have her. Not the way my heart longs to. Not in the way I imagine when my mind drifts into dreams of a life where everything is simpler. And yet, a part of me still hopes, stubborn and quiet, that in another life, one not tangled by timing, distance, or circumstance, we’ll find each other again.</p>
  <p>Maybe there, she’ll recognize me in a crowded room.
Maybe then, I won’t have to wonder if I’m allowed to reach for her.
Maybe next time, love won’t arrive too late or leave too soon.</p>
  <p>If I can’t have her here, then let it be my wish to the universe, <strong>LET ME FIND HER IN ANOTHER LIFE</strong>, where everything that stands between us now simply falls away.</p>

  <p>I knew loving her could break me someday. It wasn’t a secret I uncovered too late. It was a truth I carried from the first moment my heart leaned closer to hers.</p>
  <p>Maybe that’s the thing about real love. It doesn’t ask you to weigh the risks. It doesn’t wait for certainty. It chooses, fully aware that hearts are fragile, that even the brightest connections can be lost to time, to change, to life itself.</p>
  <p>I knew she might not stay. I knew she might outgrow the spaces we created together. And still, I loved her. I chose her in the quiet hours when doubt crept in. I chose her when the world felt heavy and uncertain. I chose her when it would have been easier to protect my heart.</p>
  <p>Because love, real love, isn’t always safe. It’s not supposed to be. It’s messy. It’s vulnerable. It’s standing there with open arms, knowing you might end up empty-handed, and doing it anyway.</p>
  <p>I didn’t love her because I was promised a future. I loved her because she made my present beautiful. Because even if tomorrow shatters everything,
today she made me believe in something pure.</p>
  <p>And if one day all this love leaves me aching, I’ll still be proud of myself. For choosing her. For feeling everything without regret. For being brave enough to love someone who never owed me anything, but gave me everything without even knowing it.</p>`

  <p>I tried, you know. I tried to find a reason, any small flaw, any tiny crack where I could slip out quietly, where I could convince myself that loving her was a mistake I could undo.</p>
  <p>But she’s too perfect. Not in the flawless, untouchable kind of way, but in the real way… the way she smiles when she’s nervous, the way she listens with her whole heart, the way her presence alone makes the world feel lighter.</p>
  <p>It’s in the little things… the way she says my name, the way she notices the details everyone else misses, the way she brings color to even the grayest days.</p>
  <p>How could I ever stop loving someone like that? How could I walk away from a soul so rare, so breathtakingly human, so unknowingly beautiful?</p>
  <p>If love were a choice, maybe I could have chosen differently. Maybe I could have saved myself from the ache that comes with loving someone who was never mine to keep. But my heart decided a long time ago, long before I realized it… that she would be the exception to every rule, the one person I would love with no conditions, no expiration date, no escape plan.</p>
<p>She’s too perfect for me to ever stop loving her, and maybe that’s not a tragedy. Maybe it’s just the purest kind of love, the kind that asks for nothing, but gives everything anyway.</p>`

  <p>It’s a strange kind of fear being scared of losing something that was never really mine to begin with. There were no promises, no claims, no certainty that she would stay in my life.</p>
  <p>And yet, somehow, she became a part of me woven into the quiet moments of my day, engraved into the way I see the world, etched into the spaces I never knew could hold this much tenderness.</p>
  <p>She’s not mine, I know that. Maybe she never was, maybe she never will be. But that doesn’t stop the fear from creeping in, from whispering in the back of my mind, “What if this beautiful thing slips away before I even understand how much it meant?”</p>
  <p>I fear losing the way her laugh makes the world softer. I fear losing the way her presence makes loneliness less sharp. I fear losing the simple, unspoken connection we share something fragile, something rare, something real.</p>
  <p>And maybe the hardest part is knowing, <strong>I DON’T HAVE THE RIGHT TO ASK HER STAY, I DON’T HAVE THE RIGHT TO CALL HER MINE.</strong> All I have is the hope that she’ll stay as long as she wants to.</p>
  <p>Even if one day she leaves, even if one day all I have are memories, loving her quietly, bravely, honestly will always be one of the most beautiful things I ever allowed myself to feel.</p>`

  <p>It’s only been 14 days since she entered my life. Just 14 days. Two short weeks. A handful of sunrises and sunsets. And yet, somehow, it feels like she’s been here all along like the missing piece I never knew I was looking for.</p>
  <p>Every conversation, every laugh, every glance she shares with me, feels so natural, so effortless, like breathing.</p>
  <p>And tonight, as I sit here thinking about her, I realize something terrifyingly beautiful, <strong>I DON’T WANT THESE 14 DAYS TO END.</strong> I want them to stretch into months, into years, into forever. I want every tomorrow to be another chance to know her a little deeper, to love her a little more.</p>
  <p>Maybe it’s foolish. Maybe it’s too soon. Maybe it’s everything people warn you against.</p>
  <p>But the heart doesn’t follow timelines. It doesn’t wait for the world’s approval. It just feels. And right now, mine is telling me one thing, louder than anything else…</p>

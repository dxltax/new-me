        <p>I didn’t just move on, I leveled up.</p>
        <p>At first, it was just about surviving. One day at a time. Breathing through the ache she left behind.</p>
        <p>I didn’t have a roadmap. Didn’t know when it would stop hurting. I just kept going, even when it felt pointless. But somewhere along the way, something shifted. The pain didn’t disappear, I just got stronger.</p>
        <p>I started showing up for myself. Fixing what I ignored. Focusing on what I used to put last, ME.</p>
        <p>I found joy in small wins. In peaceful mornings. In people who stayed. And suddenly, it wasn’t about her anymore. It was about the person I was becoming without her.</p>
        <p>I didn’t just let go of the past. I built a new future, one where I don’t settle for less than I deserve. So no, I didn’t just move on. I grew up. I glowed up. And I’m just getting started.</p>

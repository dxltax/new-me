        <p>At first, it was just about surviving. One day at a time. Breathing through the ache she left behind.</p>
        <p>I didn’t have a roadmap. Didn’t know when it would stop hurting. I just kept going, even when it felt pointless. But somewhere along the way, something shifted. The pain didn’t disappear, I just got stronger.</p>
        <p>I started showing up for myself. Fixing what I ignored. Focusing on what I used to put last, <strong>ME</strong>.</p>
        <p>I found joy in small wins. In peaceful mornings. In people who stayed. And suddenly, it wasn’t about her anymore. It was about the person I was becoming without her.</p>
        <p>I didn’t just let go of the past. I built a new future, one where I don’t settle for less than I deserve. So no, I didn’t just move on. I grew up. I glowed up. And I’m just getting started.</p>`

        <p>After her, I told myself I was done. No more getting attached. No more “what ifs.” Just me, myself, and healing.</p>
        <p>And for a while, that was exactly what I needed. Silence. Solitude. Space to rebuild.</p>
        <p>But lately, there’s been a shift. Not in a dramatic way, just in small, quiet thoughts like, “maybe one day…”</p>
        <p>Maybe one day, someone new will laugh at my dumb jokes. Hold my hand without letting go. Choose me and mean it.</p>
        <p>I’m not desperate for it. I’m not out there searching. But I’m also not pretending I don’t want to love again. Because I do. But this time, it’ll be different. This time, I’ll bring a version of me that knows her worth.</p>
        <p>She broke my heart, yes. But she didn’t break my ability to love. She just taught me how to love better, starting with myself.</p>
        <p>I’m not rushing. I’m not afraid either. I’m just walking forward, open to whatever’s meant for me.</p>`
